# Supplementary code for 'Self-intersecting curves on a pair of pants and periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows'
### by Fernando Camacho-Cadena

This is the supplementary Mathematica code for the paper [Self-intersecting curves on a pair of pants and periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows](PeriodicHamFlows.pdf). The python code was used 
to make the figures, and is not used in any of the proofs. The code is organized as follows:

### Section 1: Fock-Goncharov's reconstruction of the holonomy through coordinates

Computes the $\mathsf{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$ matrices corresponding to the holonomies of the boundary curves of the pair of pants.

### Section 2: Casimir functions (ratios of eigenvalues)

Computes the ratios of eigenvalues of the boundary holonomies. Also computes the Jacobian of the matrix induced by the Casimir functions.

### Section 3: Paramterization of symplectic leaves

Solves for level sets determined by the Casimir functions. Also has the expressions for the boundary holonomy, as well as the curve $\alpha^k\gamma^{-1}$ in the unipotent locus.

### Section 4: Functions on symplectic leaves
Defines the trace functions of different curves on the symplectic leaves.

### Section 5: Hamiltonian vector field
Computes the Hamiltonian vector field in a symplectic leaf of a given function in coordinates.

### Section 6: Convexity
Computes second derivatives along different mixed flows composed of eruption and hexagon flows.

### Section 7: Computations for $\alpha^k\gamma^{-1}$ in the unipotent locus
Computes second derivatives along eruption and hexagon flows for the unipotent locus.

### Section 8: Conjugating matrices for the eruption flow
Verifies Theorem 6.11.

### Section 9: Conjugating matrices for the hexagon flow
Verifies Theorem 6.12.
